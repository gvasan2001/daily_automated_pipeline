# ðŸ“ˆ Daily Financial Data Pipeline

This project automatically fetches stock market data, stores it in a PostgreSQL database (hosted on Railway), and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate daily investment insights.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenBB SDK** â€“ for stock data
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ for storage
- **Railway** â€“ for cloud DB hosting
- **Mistral LLM API** â€“ for generating insights

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Fetches daily stock data (AAPL)
2. Stores data in PostgreSQL
3. Sends latest data to an LLM
4. Stores LLM-generated insight and recommendations

## ðŸ“‚ Tables Required

- `market_data(symbol, date, open, high, low, close, volume)`
- `llm_insights(date, summary, recommendations)`
